NodeJs modules

Module is functionality organized in a single or multiple files. It can be reused several times.
Module has its own context.


Three types of modules:
	* Core modules - basic functionalities of Node js:
		* http
		* url
		* path
		* fs
		* ...
	* Local modules - modules that are created localy. Can be in a separate directory, but has to be exposed through JS file or index.js file. Module can be a string, function, object.

	module.exports = <variable> - exports the string, function, object as a module from the current file
	exports = <variable> - the same
	module.exports.<name_of_variable> = <variable_value> - exports the object with <name_of_variable> variable with value <variable_value>

	* Third party modules - in node_modules
