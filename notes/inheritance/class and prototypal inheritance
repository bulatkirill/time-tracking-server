Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Class & Prototypal Inheritance?

    *   Classes in JS are not the same as in languages like Java

    *   Classes are defined with the help of *constructor function* or from ES6 with "class" word
        *   class Foo {} // is equal to function Foo {}
        *   typeof Foo // 'function'
